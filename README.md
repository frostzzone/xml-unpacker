## Instructions
### T.O.C. (table of contents)
- [Getting to the site](https://github.com/frostzzone/xml-unpacker#getting-to-the-site)
- [Google drive setup](https://github.com/frostzzone/xml-unpacker#google-drive-setup)
- [Where to put png and xml](https://github.com/frostzzone/xml-unpacker#where-to-put-png-and-xml)

- 
### Getting to the site
Go [here](https://colab.research.google.com/github/frostzzone/xml-unpacker/blob/main/XML_unpacker_for_colab.ipynb) [This will copy the colab file in this repository]

You will see this

### Google drive setup
First create a new folder [name it `code`]

After, inside that folder create 2 new folders named `Input` and `Output`

### Where to put png and xml
Go inside `Input` folder and add your `Image` and it's `.xml` (I will be using a neo bf asset)

### Connecting colab to drive
To connect colab to Google drive run the first section of code, you will get a message saying it's not approved from google just click run anyways

***Image here***

it should look something like this after running

***Image here***

Click the link and sign into the google account you used for your folders, and click sign in (allow access)

Then copy the code that appears on-screen in the box where the code was run
